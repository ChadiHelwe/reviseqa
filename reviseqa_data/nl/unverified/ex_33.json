The natural language statement 'A person is either resilient or fearless, but not necessarily both' implies that it is possible for a person to be both resilient and fearless. The FOL uses exclusive OR (`\u2295`), which means `(p_6(x) \u2228 p_2(x)) \u2227 \u00ac(p_6(x) \u2227 p_2(x))`. The phrase 'not necessarily both' in the natural language statement indicates an inclusive OR (`\u2228`), meaning `p_6(x) \u2228 p_2(x)` where the case `p_6(x) \u2227 p_2(x)` is permitted, not negated. Thus, the FOL statement is more restrictive and does not accurately capture the meaning of the natural language statement."
