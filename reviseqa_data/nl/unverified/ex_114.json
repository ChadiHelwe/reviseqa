One common interpretation of the NL phrase \"If X, then not necessarily Y\" when applied to a specific instance is `X \u2192 \u00acY` (if X is true, then Y is false). Under this interpretation, the NL sentence becomes `(p_1(Khloe) \u2192 \u00acp_10(Khloe)) \u2227 (p_10(Khloe) \u2192 \u00acp_1(Khloe))`. These two formulas are not equivalent. For example, if `p_1(Khloe)` is false and `p_10(Khloe)` is false:  FOL (`p_1(Khloe) \u2295 p_10(Khloe)`) evaluates to `False \u2295 False = False`. The NL interpretation (`(False \u2192 \u00acFalse) \u2227 (False \u2192 \u00acFalse)`) evaluates to `(False \u2192 True) \u2227 (False \u2192 True)`, which is `True \u2227 True = True`.

The FOL statement `A \u2295 B` (exclusive OR) asserts that for Khloe, exactly one of A (`p_1(Khloe)`) or B (`p_10(Khloe)`) is true, meaning `(A \u2227 \u00acB) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 B)`. The natural language statement, 'If A, then not necessarily B, and if B, then not necessarily A,' means that A does not entail B, and B does not entail A. This NL statement is compatible with Khloe being in a state where both A and B are true (e.g., she makes local friends AND learns a language) or where both A and B are false. In these two cases (`A \u2227 B` or `\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB`), the FOL statement `A \u2295 B` would be false, but the NL statement (interpreted as a lack of necessary implication) could still be considered true.
