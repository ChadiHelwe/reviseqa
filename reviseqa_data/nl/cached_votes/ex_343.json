The FOL antecedent p_1 \u2295 p_2 (exclusive OR) is derived from (p_1\u2228p_2)\u2227(\u00acp_1\u2228\u00acp_2). The NL phrase 'Lucian either listens more or speaks less (or both)' indicates inclusive OR (p_1 \u2228 p_2). The additional NL clause 'as long as not both are false or both are true', when its internal 'or' is parsed as inclusive, i.e., (\u00ac(\u00acp_1\u2227\u00acp_2)) \u2228 (\u00ac(p_1\u2227p_2)), simplifies to (p_1\u2228p_2) \u2228 (\u00acp_1\u2228\u00acp_2).
