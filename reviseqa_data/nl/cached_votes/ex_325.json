The natural language phrase 'either...or..., but not necessarily both' typically signifies an inclusive OR (\u2228), meaning that it's possible for both conditions (pursuing passion and expressing emotion) to be true simultaneously. However, the FOL uses the exclusive OR operator (\u2295), which means that exactly one of the conditions can be true, but not both. Therefore, the FOL representation doesn't allow for the possibility of a person both pursuing their passion and expressing emotion, contrary to the implication of the NL statement."
