Given that other statements in the problem set use the explicit phrasing \"(but not both)\" when \u2295 is intended (e.g., statement 10 and 11), and one statement (#12) translates \"either...or\" to an inclusive OR (\u2228), the use of \u2295 here for \"either enjoy experimenting or value flavors\" is likely a misrepresentation.

In natural language, this phrasing typically implies inclusive OR (A or B or both, represented as `A \u2228 B`), unless exclusivity ('but not both') is explicitly stated. However, the corresponding FOL statement `\u2200x (p_12(x) \u2192 (p_4(x) \u2295 p_13(x)))` uses the exclusive OR operator (`\u2295`), meaning 'A or B, but not both A and B'.  This interpretation is stricter than the natural language suggests. This is further highlighted by other examples provided: statement 5 correctly uses `\u2228` for 'either...or...' without an explicit 'but not both', while statements 3, 4, and 6 correctly use `\u2295` when the natural language includes 'but not both'."

Other statements in the provided list correctly distinguish between 'either...or' (mapped to inclusive OR, e.g., item 13) and 'either...or (but not both)' (mapped to exclusive OR, e.g., items 10, 11, 12, 14, 18).
