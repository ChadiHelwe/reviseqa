However, the corresponding FOL statement uses exclusive OR (A \u2295 B), as in '(p_12(Brecken) \u2295 p_13(Brecken)) \u2192 p_1(Brecken)'. This means the FOL asserts the consequence only if exactly one of A or B is true, whereas the NL implies the consequence if at least one (and possibly both) of A or B is true. For example, if Brecken is both confident (p_12) and speaks frankly (p_13), the NL antecedent ('either confident or speaks frankly') would be true (inclusive OR), implying she leads others (p_1). But in the FOL, the antecedent (p_12 \u2295 p_13) would be false, making the implication vacuously true regardless of whether she leads others or not. This discrepancy occurs in multiple similar translations in the provided list (e.g., also for 'If Brecken is either self-reliant or takes risks, then she is confident')."
