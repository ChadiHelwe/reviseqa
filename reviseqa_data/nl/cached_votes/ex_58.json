The FOL statement uses `\u2295` (exclusive OR), which means \"one or the other, but *not* both\". This is a stronger claim than is necessarily present in the natural language. If Izaiah is both an athlete and competes fiercely, the antecedent of the natural language statement (interpreted inclusively) would be true, and the statement's truth would depend on whether he performs well. However, the FOL antecedent `(p_7(Izaiah) \u2295 p_9(Izaiah))` would be false, making the entire FOL implication vacuously true, regardless of whether he performs well. This divergence in truth conditions for a key scenario indicates a mismatch. Other examples in the context show `\u2295` being incorrectly used for \"either ... or ..., but not necessarily both\" (which is inclusive), suggesting a pattern of overusing `\u2295` for \"either...or\" constructions."
