            "mistake": "The predicate p_11(x) is used inconsistently across different natural language statements. For example, in item 17 (NL: Reid cannot make discoveries, FOL: \u00acp_11(Reid)), p_11(Reid) is interpreted as 'Reid can make discoveries'. However, in item 5 (NL: If Reid either explores nature or makes discoveries (but not both), then he thinks creatively. FOL: (p_2(Reid) \u2295 p_11(Reid)) \u2192 p_12(Reid)), p_11(Reid) is used to represent 'Reid makes discoveries'. The statement 'Reid makes discoveries' implies 'Reid can make discoveries', but they are not logically equivalent. This inconsistent mapping leads to a mismatch. For instance, if p_11(x) means 'x can make discoveries' (as implied by item 17), then for item 5, the NL statement 'Reid makes discoveries' (a strong assertion) is mapped to p_11(Reid) which means 'Reid can make discoveries' (a weaker assertion). If this is part of an antecedent, it changes the logical meaning of the statement. Specifically, for item 5, if p_2(Reid) is false, p_12(Reid) is false, Reid does not make discoveries (MD is false) but Reid can make discoveries (p_11(Reid) is true), the NL statement (F \u2295 F) \u2192 F is True, while the FOL statement (F \u2295 T) \u2192 F is False."
