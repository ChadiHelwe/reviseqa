However, the natural language statement \"A person is either an expert in their field or teaches others, but not necessarily both\" implies an inclusive OR (`\u2228`). The phrase \"but not necessarily both\" typically clarifies that the scenario where both conditions are true is permitted and valid, meaning the statement logically translates to `\u2200x (p_6(x) \u2228 p_13(x))`. The use of `\u2295` (XOR) in the FOL is therefore an incorrect mapping of the natural language sentence."
