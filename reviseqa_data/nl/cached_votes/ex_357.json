The natural language phrase 'either...or...' in this conditional context is more naturally interpreted as an inclusive OR (\u2228). The FOL using \u2295 means that if an individual has both a fever (p_3(x)) and is ill (p_12(x)), the antecedent (p_3(x) \u2295 p_12(x)) is false. This makes the implication true regardless of whether they need care (p_4(x)), failing to capture the NL implication that they *would* need care if both conditions are met."

The FOL uses XOR (one or the other, but not both), but the NL does not specify this exclusivity. There is another mismatch at FOL: p_3(Koen) \u2192 p_0(Koen) with NL: 'If Koen has a fever, then he is healthy.'
