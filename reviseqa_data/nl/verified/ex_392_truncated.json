However, in a preceding pair ('FOL: \u2200x (p_7(x) \u2192 p_5(x)), NL: All activists who drive change are truly committed to their cause'), the predicate p_5(x) was established to mean 'x is truly committed to their cause'.

In pair 13 (FOL: `\u2200x (p_7(x) \u2192 p_5(x))`, NL: 'All activists who drive change are truly committed to their cause.'), the predicate `p_5(x)` is implicitly defined as 'x is truly committed to their cause.' However, in pair 17 (FOL: `p_5(Bria)`, NL: 'Bria is genuine.'), the same predicate `p_5(Bria)` is mapped to 'Bria is genuine.' While 'genuine' and 'truly committed to their cause' are related concepts, they are not strictly synonymous. A predicate should have a consistent semantic mapping. Thus, pair 17 incorrectly maps `p_5(Bria)` if the definition from pair 13 is primary."
