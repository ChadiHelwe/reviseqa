This corresponds to an inclusive OR (represented by \u2228) for the conditions. The provided FOL statement is `\u2200x ((p_12(x) \u2295 p_13(x)) \u2192 p_3(x))`, where `p_12(x)` is 'x gives back to their community', `p_13(x)` is 'x mentors youth', and `p_3(x)` is 'x is making a difference'. The symbol `\u2295` represents exclusive OR (XOR), meaning the condition `(p_12(x) \u2295 p_13(x))` is true only if exactly one of `p_12(x)` or `p_13(x)` is true. If an individual performs both actions (both `p_12(x)` and `p_13(x)` are true), the antecedent `(p_12(x) \u2295 p_13(x))` becomes false. Consequently, the implication `False \u2192 p_3(x)` is vacuously true, which means the FOL rule does not enforce that `p_3(x)` ('x is making a difference') must be true in this scenario. This contradicts the common understanding of the natural language statement, which suggests that doing both activities also qualifies as making a difference. A more faithful FOL representation would use an inclusive OR: `\u2200x ((p_12(x) \u2228 p_13(x)) \u2192 p_3(x))`."

Using \u2295 implies that if an individual `x` both `p_12(x)` (gives back to their community) and `p_13(x)` (mentors youth), the condition `p_12(x) \u2295 p_13(x)` is false, and thus the rule does not assert they are `p_3(x)` (making a difference).
