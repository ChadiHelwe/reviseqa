The FOL statement `\u2200x (p_6(x) \u2295 p_12(x))` asserts that for every individual x, x either earns recognition (p_6(x)) or puts others first (p_12(x)), but not both, and critically, not neither. This means every individual must satisfy exactly one of these conditions. The Natural Language statement translates to two conjoined existential claims: 1) \u2203x such that (p_6(x) \u2227 \u00acp_12(x)) (meaning it's not true that all who earn recognition put others first) AND 2) \u2203y such that (p_12(y) \u2227 \u00acp_6(y)) (meaning it's not true that all who put others first earn recognition). The NL statement allows for individuals who satisfy both p_6 and p_12, or neither, as long as these two types of individuals exist. The FOL's universal XOR is a much stronger claim, mandating universal mutual exclusivity (no one has both properties) AND universal joint exhaustiveness (no one has neither property) for every individual, which is not what the NL statement conveys and can lead to the FOL being true while the NL is false."

The corresponding natural language statement, 'Everyone who earns recognition does not necessarily put others first, and everyone who puts others first does not necessarily earn recognition,' translates logically to `(\u2203x (p_6(x) \u2227 \u00acp_12(x))) \u2227 (\u2203y (p_12(y) \u2227 \u00acp_6(y)))`.

The FOL is a much stronger universal claim about each individual's properties, while the NL makes existential claims about the population. The NL can be true even if some individuals possess both properties (p_6 and p_12) or neither, which the FOL `\u2200x (p_6(x) \u2295 p_12(x))` explicitly prohibits."
