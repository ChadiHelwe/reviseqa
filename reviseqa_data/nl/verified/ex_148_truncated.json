In natural language, \"either A or B\" is often interpreted as inclusive OR (A \u2228 B) unless exclusivity is explicitly stated (e.g., \"but not both\"). The corresponding FOL statement is `(p_10(Jazmin) \u2295 p_2(Jazmin)) \u2192 p_1(Jazmin)`, which uses exclusive OR (\u2295) for the antecedent. These two forms (inclusive OR vs. exclusive OR in the antecedent of an implication) are not logically equivalent. For example, if Jazmin is both creative (p_10 is True) and thinks outside the box (p_2 is True), the FOL antecedent `p_10(Jazmin) \u2295 p_2(Jazmin)` is False, making the entire implication True regardless of `p_1(Jazmin)`. However, with inclusive OR, the antecedent `p_10(Jazmin) \u2228 p_2(Jazmin)` would be True, and the truth of the implication `(True \u2192 p_1(Jazmin))` would depend on `p_1(Jazmin)`.

FOL: '((p_10(Jazmin) \u2295 p_2(Jazmin)) \u2192 p_1(Jazmin))'. The natural language 'either A or B' in this context, and by comparison to other statements in the problem (where 'either A or B, but not both' signifies XOR, and 'either A or B (or both)' signifies inclusive OR), implies an inclusive OR (\u2228). However, the FOL statement uses an exclusive OR (\u2295). The FOL should have been '((p_10(Jazmin) \u2228 p_2(Jazmin)) \u2192 p_1(Jazmin))'. Another mistake exists in item 24 where the antecedent of the implication is mismatched."
