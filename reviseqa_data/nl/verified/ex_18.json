However, in the last statement, 'For all humans, if a person is a doctor and has acute observation skills, then they can solve medical mysteries', its FOL representation \u2200x ((p_5(x) \u2227 p_6(x)) \u2192 p_7(x)) would translate to '...then they solve medical mysteries' using the established meaning of p_7(x). The NL phrase 'can solve medical mysteries' indicates an ability or potential, which is subtly different from actively 'solving medical mysteries'. Therefore, the FOL p_7(x) in the last statement does not perfectly match its corresponding NL phrase 'can solve medical mysteries' if p_7(x) consistently means 'x solves medical mysteries' as established earlier."
