Assuming `p_11(Case)` means \"Case reads tracks\" (or \"Case reads tracks effectively\" as suggested by its use in other statements), the FOL translates to \"(Case reads tracks) XOR (Case anticipates turns in order to excel in racing competitions)\". However, the natural language statement \"Case either reads tracks or anticipates turns, but not both, in order to excel in racing competitions\" implies that the purpose \"in order to excel...\" applies to the entire XORed action of \"reading tracks\" and \"anticipating turns\".  The FOL only incorporates this purpose for the \"anticipates turns\" part (via `p_4`) and not for the \"reads tracks\" part. The NL would be better represented as `(reads_tracks(Case) \u2295 anticipates_turns(Case)) \u2192 excels(Case)` or as `reads_tracks_to_excel(Case) \u2295 anticipates_turns_to_excel(Case)`.

In the FOL, the purpose clause is embedded only within `p_4(Case)` and is not expressed as the purpose of the overarching XOR relationship.
