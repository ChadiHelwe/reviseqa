    "background_story": "Crew was raised in a strict, traditional household where morals and values were upheld with unwavering rigidity. His parents, adhering to a puritanical lifestyle, taught him that hard work, humility, and simplicity were the keys to a righteous life. Crew grew up with a strong sense of duty and responsibility, often finding himself at odds with the more liberal views of his peers. He believed in modesty and self-control, avoiding excesses and frivolities. Despite his strict upbringing, Crew had a compassionate heart and was always willing to lend a helping hand. His community respected him for his integrity and strong principles, even if they didn't always agree with his conservative views. Crew's life was a testament to the enduring power of traditional values in a rapidly changing world.",
