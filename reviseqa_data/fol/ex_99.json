    "background_story": "Sweetstuff was a rare and beautiful horse, known for her striking coat and gentle disposition. But what made her truly unique was her love for the hybanthus flower, a rare and exquisite bloom that only grew on the highest hills of the ranch. Every spring, Sweetstuff would make a pilgrimage to these hills, where she would graze on the sweet, fragrant flowers. As she ate, her coat would take on a subtle sheen, and her mane would grow strong and healthy. The ranchers believed that the hybanthus held mystical properties, and that Sweetstuff's love for the flower was a sign of her own special spirit. And indeed, Sweetstuff seemed to possess a deep wisdom and kindness, always knowing when someone needed comfort or guidance.",
