    "background_story": "In a small meadow, a butterfly named Dewdrop lived a life of wonder. However, her world was turned upside down when she accidentally flew into a patch of flowers that had been sprayed with a mysterious drogue. The substance, meant to calm aggressive insects, had an unexpected effect on Dewdrop. Instead of calming her, it heightened her senses and made her incredibly agile. With her newfound abilities, Dewdrop found herself leading a group of butterflies in daring aerial acrobatics. But as time passed, she realized the drogue's effects were temporary and came with a price. Determined to find a way to break free from its influence, Dewdrop embarked on a journey to discover the source of the drogue and save her meadow from its unintended consequences.",
