    "background_story": "Banks was a charismatic figure, known for his extravagant lifestyle on the fringes of society. He moved effortlessly through the demimonde, a world of underground clubs, secret societies, and high-stakes dealings. By day, he was a respectable businessman, but by night, he donned a different cloak, navigating the shadows of the city's underbelly. His acquaintances were a mix of artists, musicians, and other free spirits, all bound together by their rejection of mainstream norms. Banks' apartment, a lavish penthouse, was a salon for these misfits, where they would gather to discuss philosophy, art, and the meaning of life. Though his existence was a balancing act between light and darkness, Banks thrived in this demimonde, where the lines between right and wrong were blissfully blurred.",
