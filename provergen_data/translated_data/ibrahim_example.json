    "background_story": "Ibrahim was a seasoned mountaineer with a passion for exploring the Scottish Highlands. On one of his solo expeditions, he stumbled upon an ancient cairn, a pile of stones marking a long-forgotten path. As he reached the top of the cairned peak, he felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and connection to the land. The cairn, built by previous travelers, served as a beacon, guiding him through the rugged terrain. Ibrahim felt a deep respect for those who had come before him, leaving their mark on the mountain. He added his own stone to the cairn, symbolizing his own journey and leaving a legacy for future explorers. From that day on, Ibrahim felt a sense of responsibility to preserve the natural beauty of the Highlands and honor the traditions of those who had cairned the path before him.",
